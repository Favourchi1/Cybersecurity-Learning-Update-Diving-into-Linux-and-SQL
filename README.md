#  Cybersecurity Learning Update: Diving into Linux & SQL

Welcome to another update in my cybersecurity learning journey!  
Today’s focus was on **Linux** and **SQL** — two powerful tools every cybersecurity professional should be comfortable with.

##  Understanding Linux

Linux is an **open-source operating system** that serves as the bridge between a computer’s hardware and the user. It supports both:

- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Command Line Interface (CLI)

These are essential for effective system interaction and administration.

###  Core Components of Linux:

- User  
- Applications  
- Shell  
- Filesystem Hierarchy  
- Kernel  
- Hardware  

###  Popular Linux Distributions in Cybersecurity:

- **Kali Linux**
- **Ubuntu**

---

##  Hands-On Practice (via Qwiklabs)

I engaged in real-world Linux labs where I:

- Navigated Linux environments
- Installed and uninstalled applications using the APT package manager and `sudo`
- Managed files and directories
- Changed file permissions
- Handled user accounts using the **principle of least privilege**

---

##  Getting Started with SQL

**Structured Query Language (SQL)** is a fundamental tool for interacting with databases.

###  What I Learned:

- Creating and interacting with databases
- Filtering and querying data
- Manipulating information stored in tables

---

##  Final Thoughts

It’s exciting to build both **practical** and **technical** skills using real-world tools.  
I’m looking forward to learning even more and continuing to document this cybersecurity journey!
